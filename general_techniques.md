# Arrays
## Duplicate in Array
Use set or hash to keep a count
```python
def repeatedNumber(self, A):
    n = len(A)
    # list to keep the count of integers in A
    C = [0 for i in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(len(A)):
        C[A[i]] = C[A[i]]+1
        if(C[A[i]]==2):
            return A[i]
    return -1
```
## Largest Number
- To create the largest number from an array of numbers, use any comparison sort by comparing two numbers XY and YX
  - e.g., for 12 and 120, compare 12120 and 12012 and put the largest number first.
  - Sort the entire array and join the sorted array.

## Max Contiguous Sum of Sub Array
- O(n) time
- Keep track of current max and current sum. Set current sum to current num if current num is greater than the sum.

```ruby
def maxSubArray(a)
  curr_max = a.first 
  curr_sum = a.first

  a[1..-1].each do |num|
    curr_sum += num

    if num > curr_sum
      curr_sum = num
    end

    if curr_sum > curr_max
      curr_max = curr_sum
    end
  end
  
  curr_max
end
```

## Pascal Nth Row
``` ruby
def PascalRow(n)
  return [1] if n.zero?
  return [1,1] if n == 1

  prev = PascalRow(n - 1)
  row = []
  (0..(prev.length - 2)).each do |i|
      row << prev[i] + prev[i + 1]
  end

  [1] + row + [1]
end
```

# Math
## Binary Number
```ruby
 def findDigitsInBinary(a)
   return "0" if a == 0

   num = []
   while a > 0 
     num.unshift(a % 2)
     a /= 2
   end
   num.join
 end
```
or

```ruby
 def findDigitsInBinary(a)
   a.to_s(2)
 end
```

## Base Number Conversion
- For any base N, divide the decimal number by N and keep track of the remainders.

## Base 26 Conversion - number to alpha
- Subtract 1 to account for zero index array!
- Append to beginning so it's reversed

``` ruby
def numberToAlpha(a)
  alpha = ("A".."Z").to_a
  res = ""

  while a > 0 
    remainder = (a - 1) % 26
    result = alpha[remainder] + result
    a = (a - 1)/26
  end
  res
end
```

## Base 26 Conversion - alpha to number
- Reverse the string
- Keep track of index - this is like the 10th, 100th place
``` ruby
def alphaToNumber(a)
  alpha = ('A'..'Z').to_a
  res = 0
  a.reverse.split('').each_with_index do |ch, idx|
    pos = alpha.index(ch) + 1
    power = 26**idx
    res += power*pos
  end
  res
end
```

## Factors
- Need to only check up to sqrt of `n`

```ruby
  def allFactors(n)
    factors = []
    limit = (n**0.5).to_i
    (1..limit).each do |num|
      if n % num == 0
        factors << num
        factors << n / num
      end
    end
    
    return factors.uniq.sort
  end
```

## GCD
- `gcd(a, b) = gcd(a % b, b)` for `a > b` 
- Find max of two numbers first, swap as necessary
- Check if `a` or `b` is zero first - every integer is a divisor of zero

```ruby
 def gcd(a, b)
   a, b = b, a if b > a
   if b == 0
     return a
   end
  
   return gcd(a % b, b)       
 end
```

## Grid Unique Paths
- Count all paths from top to bottom of `mxn` matrix
- Time complexity of first example is O(2^m) - exponential

```ruby
def uniquePaths(a, b)
  return 1 if a == 1 || b == 1
  
  uniquePaths(a - 1, b) + uniquePaths(a, b -1)
end
```
- Use dynamic programming to make time complexity of O(mn)

## Primes
- Check for prime factors up to the square root of `n`. Time complexity: `O(sqrt(n))`
- Remember to check for n = 0, 1 first

## Trailing Zeros
- Find number of multiples of 5, since 5*2 = 10, and there are far more 2's than 5's.
  - If dividing by 5 results in a decimal, truncate to whole number.
- Time Complexity: `O(logn)`

```ruby
 def trailingZeroes(a)
   i = 5
   count = 0
   while i <= a #i < 1
     count += a/i
     i *= 5
   end
   count
end
```
or

```ruby
def trailingZeroes(a)
  n = 0
  while(a != 0)
    n += a/5
    a/=5
  end
  n
end
```

# Hashing
## Anagrams
``` ruby
def anagrams(a)
  hash = {}
  a.each_with_index do |word, i|
    key = word.chars.sort(&:casecmp).join
    if hash[key]
      hash[key] << (i + 1)
    else
      hash[key] = [i + 1]
    end    
  end
  hash.values
end
```

## Longest Continuous Sequence that Sums to Zero
- Track the cumulative sums (1 to `i`) in a hash with the index at that sum
- Keep a start variable that points to the last index
- If the sum is equal to a previous index, then the segment between the two indices must sum to zero
- Set the start index to the previous index if a new longer sequence is found

```ruby
def longest_continuous_sum_zero(arr)
  return arr if arr.empty?
  
  sums = {0 => -1}
  max_len = 0
  sum = 0
  start = arr.length
  (0..arr.length - 1).each do |i|
    sum += arr[i]
    prev_idx = sums[sum]
    if prev_idx 
      len = i - prev_idx
      if len > max_length 
        max_length = len
        start = prev_idx
      elsif (len == max_length) && (prev_idx < start)
        start = prev_idx
      end
    else
      sums[sum] = i
    end
  end
  
  arr[(start+1)..(start+max_length)]
end
```

# Strings
## Longest Palindrome Substring
- `O(n)` linear time and space (Manacherâ€™s Algorithm)
```ruby
def longest_palindrome(str)
  return str if str.length <= 1
  
  # convert string for easier processing
  s = "$*" + str.split("").join("*") + "*!"
  
  lengths = {} # hash to store max lengths at each index
  center, right = 0, 0 # center and right (end) indices of palindrome
  
  (1..s.length).each do |i|
    i_mirror = center - (i - center)
    
    # get i based on previously calculated lengths of mirror index i'
    if right > i 
      lengths[i] = [right - i, lengths[i_mirror]].min
    else 
      lengths[i] = 0 
    end
    
    # look for palindrome by expanding around i
    while s[i + 1 + lengths[i]] == s[i - 1 - lengths[i]]
      lengths[i] += 1
    end
    
    # set new center if end of new palindrome is past the current end
    if i + lengths[i] > right
      center = i
      right = center + lengths[i]
    end
  end
  
  # find the max length
  max_length = lengths.values.max
  center_i = lengths.key(max_length)
  
  # return the max palindrome string - make sure to use orig string here
  str[(center_i - max_length)/2, max_length]
end
```

- Alternative method is to just check for longest palindrome centered around a point and expand from there.
   - Time: `O(n^2)`, Space: `O(1)`

``` ruby
def longest_palindrome(str)  
  longest = ""  
  
  (0..str.size-1).each do |i| 
    # odd length
    odd = form_palindrome(str, i, i)  
    longest = odd if odd.size > longest.size 
    
    # even length
    even = form_palindrome(str, i, i+1)  
    longest = even if even.size > longest.size  
  end 
  
  longest  
end  

def form_palindrome(str, left, right)  
  palindrome = "" 
  
  while (left >= 0 && right < str.size && str[left] == str[right])  
    palindrome = str[left..right]  
    left -= 1  
    right += 1  
  end  
  
  palindrome   
end
```


# Other Data Structures



## Hash Map
- Key value pairs stored in hash buckets of Linked Lists
- Hash the key before moding by number of buckets
- Resize when number of items in linked list is >= total number of buckets
- Delete, insert, and lookup are all O(1)

## LRU Cache
- Use hash map and linked list
- Remove the least recently used item in a cache (linked list) when it's full
- Hash map points to node object in linked list, allowing for O(1) lookup
- Delete, insert, and lookup are all O(1)

# Sorting
## Heap Sort
### Binary Heap
- A complete binary tree where the parent node value is either always greater (max heap) or smaller (min heap)
- Array based representation
  - Children indices are `2i + 1`, `2i + 2`
- Peeking at min/max O(1)
- Insertion O(log n)
- Extraction O(log n)

### Implementation
- O(n log n) worse case
- Build a max heap of size n
- The root element will be the largest in the array 
  - Swap the root with the last element to remove to root
  - Heapify down to place the swapped element in the right position
  - Decrease the length by 1
- Repeat until size is 1

## Graphs
- |V| = # vertices
- |E| = # edges
- density = |E| / |V| ( |V| - 1 )
  - max density = 1 (undirected), 2 (directed)
  - min density = 0

## Topological Sort
### Use Cases
- Scheduling tasks/dependencies
- Webpack
- Minimal Spanning Tree
### Kahn's Alogorithm
1. Queue all vertices with no in-edges
2. Pop off vertices from queues
 - Remove vertex and out-edges
 - Push vertex into sorted array
 - Examine destination vertices. Push and queue if no more in-edges
 - Repeat
 ### Coffman-Graham Algorithm
 - Modified Kahn's that is deterministic
 ### Depth First Search
