# General Techniques and Concepts

## Checking for Primes
- Check for prime factors up to the square root of `n`. Time complexity: `O(sqrt(n))`
- Remember to check for n = 0, 1, or 2 first.

## Graphs
- |V| = # vertices
- |E| = # edges
- density = |E| / |V| ( |V| - 1 )
  - max density = 1 (undirected), 2 (directed)
  - min density = 0
