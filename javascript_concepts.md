# JavaScript Concepts

## Pure Functions
- Given the same input, will always return the same output
- Produces no side effects

### Use Cases
- Form the foundation of functional programming
- Parallel processing across many CPU's and distributed computer clusters
  - Good for resource intensive computing tasks

## Closures
- "A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared." - MDN web docs
- Lexical environment - the surrounding state
- Closures give you access to the outer function's scope from the inner function.
- In javascript, you create a closure everytime you create a function.
- To use a closure, create a function inside another function and expose it by returning or passing to another function.
  - The inner function has access to the other functions variables even after the outer function returns.
### Use Cases
- Data Privacy 
  - Enclosed variables are only accesible within the containing outer function.
 Â - You can only get the data from an object's privileged methods.
    - **Priviledged method** - any exposed method defined within the closure scope
  - Stateful functions - return values may influenced by their internal state
- Partial Applications & Currying
  - The process of applying a function to some of its arguments.
  - The partially applied function gets returned for later use.
  - Takes advantage of closure scope to *fix* parameters
- Practical Applications 
  - Callbacks - e.g. commonly used in web - define a behavior that is attached to some event, usually triggered by the user.

## Functional Programming
- Build software with pure functions -> avoids shared states, mutable data, side-effects
- Type of programming paradigm (e.g., OOP, procedural programming)
- Declarative over imperative
  - **Declarative programming** expresses logic, without specifying control flow. Looks at data flow. - WHAT
    - Uses expressions (piece of code that evaluates to value) over statements (if, for, switch) 
  - **Imperative programming** uses statements that change a program's state. - HOW
- Favors pure functions
### Key Concepts
- Avoids Shared State issues such as:
  - Race condition
  - Order of function calls matter, as functions are timing dependent
- Immutability over mutable data
  - `const` is not immutable
    - Can't change obj that binding refers to, but can change obj properties -> mutable
  - `Object.freeze` - freezes only one level
  - Trie data structures - deep frozen
    - Uses structural sharing to share reference memory locations
- Reduces Side Effects
  - Side effects are any app state change observable outside the function other than its return value.
    - Modifying external variable
    - Console logging
    - Writing to a file or network
    - Triggering any external process
    - Calling other functions with side effects
- Reusability Through Higher Order Functions
  - Higher order function - takes a function as an arg, returns a func, or both
    - Abstract or isolate actions -> callbacks, promises, monads
    - Create util for acting on multiple data types
    - Curried functions
    - Function composition
      - The process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function
  - Functor - something that can be mapped over
    - e.g. Array container
